        1,3-dihydroxybutane) is an organic chemical, an alcohol. It is commonly used as a solvent for food
        flavouring agents. It is one of four stable structural isomers of butanediol. In biology, 1,3-butanediol is
        used as a hypoglycaemic agent. 1,3-Butanediol can be converted into β-hydroxybutyrate and serve as a
        substrate for brain metabolism.

    <string name="E1503" translatable="false">In the food industry, castor oil (food grade) is used in food
        additives, flavorings, candy (e.g., polyglycerol polyricinoleate or PGPR in chocolate), as a mold inhibitor,
        and in packaging. Polyoxyethylated castor oil (e.g., Kolliphor EL) is also used in the food industries. In
        India, Pakistan and Nepal food grains are preserved by the application of castor oil. It stops rice, wheat,
        and pulses from rotting. For example, the legume pigeon pea is commonly available coated in oil for extended
        storage.

    <string name="E1504" translatable="false">Ethyl acetate is the most common ester in wine, being the product of
        the most common volatile organic acid – acetic acid, and the ethyl alcohol generated during the
        fermentation. The aroma of ethyl acetate is most vivid in younger wines and contributes towards the general
        perception of \"fruitiness\" in the wine. Sensitivity varies, with most people having a perception threshold
        around 120 mg/L. Excessive amounts of ethyl acetate are considered a wine fault. Exposure to oxygen can
        exacerbate the fault due to the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, which leaves the wine with a sharp
        vinegar-like taste.

    <string name="E1505" translatable="false">Triethyl citrate is an ester of citric acid. It is a colorless,

        egg white. It is also used in pharmaceutical coatings and plastics.

    <string name="E1510" translatable="false">Sweet sorghum is another potential source of ethanol, and is suitable
        for growing in dryland conditions. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics
        (ICRISAT) is investigating the possibility of growing sorgham as a source of fuel, food, and animal feed in
        arid parts of Asia and Africa. Sweet sorghum has one-third the water requirement of sugarcane over the same
        time period. It also requires about 22% less water than corn (also known as maize). The world’s first sweet
        sorghum ethanol distillery began commercial production in 2007 in Andhra Pradesh, India.

    <string name="E1519" translatable="false">Benzyl alcohol is an aromatic alcohol with the formula C6H5CH2OH. The
        benzyl group is often abbreviated \"Bn\" (not to be confused with \"Bz\" which is used for benzoyl), thus
        benzyl alcohol is denoted as BnOH. Benzyl alcohol is a colorless liquid with a mild pleasant aromatic odor.
        It is a useful solvent due to its polarity, low toxicity, and low vapor pressure. Benzyl alcohol has
        moderate solubility in water (4 g/100 mL) and is miscible in alcohols and diethyl ether. The anion produced
        by deprotonation of the alcohol group is known as benzylate or benzyloxide.

    <string name="E1521" translatable="false">PEG is generally considered biologically inert and safe. However,
        studies of clinical safety are generally based on adults, not children. The FDA has been asked to
        investigate the possible effects of PEG in laxatives for children. Also, a minority of people are allergic
        to it. Allergy to PEG is usually discovered after a person has been diagnosed with an allergy to an
        increasing number of seemingly unrelated products, including processed foods, cosmetics, drugs, and other
        substances that contain PEG or were manufactured with PEG.

        improve the drugs\' dissolution in the gastrointestinal fluids. This process is known as hydrophilization.
